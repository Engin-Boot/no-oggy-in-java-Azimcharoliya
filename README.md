# Collections Exercise

## Intention

This program intends to remove strings containing 'oggy' from a list of strings.
Removing 'oggy' from list will make the world better and cool.

## Method

The idea is to use the Iterator for looping through the list collection.
The iterator() method in Java is used to get an Iterator for the list collection.
The hasNext() and next() methods of the Iterator are used for looping.

Iterators are designed to easily change the collections that they loop through.
Hence the iterator is used as it allows concurrrent modification in list.

The remove() method is used to remove elements from a list while looping.
