# Collections Exercise

## Intention

This program intends to remove strings containing 'oggy' from a list of strings.
Removing 'oggy' from list will make the world better and cool.

## Method

The idea is to use the Iterator for looping through the list collection. The iterator() method in Java is used to get an Iterator for the list collection.
To loop through the list, the hasNext() and next() methods of the Iterator are used in the method.

Iterators are designed to easily change the collections that they loop through. Hence the iterator is used as it allows concurrrent modification along with looping in list.

The remove() method is used to remove string containing 'oggy' from a list collection while looping.
