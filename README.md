# Collections Exercise

## Intention

This program intends to remove strings containing 'oggy' from a list of strings.
Removing 'oggy' from list will make the world better and cool.

## Method

The idea is to use the Iterator for looping through the list collection.

Iterators allows to change the collections that they loop through.
Hence the Iterator allows concurrent modification in the list.

The remove() method removes elements from a list while looping.
